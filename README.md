# ProtoDatastore

This is the first time I've worked with Protobuf and Datastore

This project is to READ and WRITE User Info in Protobuf language. Just input username, firstName, lastName and phoneNumber. After that, click Add and the User Info will be written in user_prefs.pb file with encoded format. Instantly, you will see User Info, which is read from user_prefs.pb file.

To see the user_prefs.pb file, please go to this directory: data/data/{{package_name}}/files/datastore/user_prefs.pb
